		<summary>Interstellar – Summary
		In a future where Earth is dying due to crop failures and dust storms, former NASA pilot Cooper lives with his family, including his brilliant daughter Murph. Strange gravitational anomalies in their home lead them to a secret NASA base, where Cooper learns that a wormhole has appeared near Saturn. It may lead to habitable planets in another galaxy.

NASA plans a mission to explore three promising planets. Cooper agrees to pilot the mission, leaving Murph behind, who feels betrayed. Along with scientists including Dr. Brand, Cooper travels through the wormhole. On each planet, they face extreme conditions and devastating time dilation — hours on one planet equal years on Earth.

Back on Earth, Murph joins NASA and works to solve the equation needed to evacuate humanity. She eventually realizes the mysterious "ghost" from her childhood was her future father communicating through time and gravity — Cooper, using a fifth-dimensional tesseract inside a black hole to send quantum data back to her.

Using this data, Murph solves the gravity equation, saving humanity. Cooper survives and is rescued, waking up on a space station orbiting Saturn named after Murph. In the end, he sets off to find Brand, who is establishing a new colony on one of the planets.</summary>
